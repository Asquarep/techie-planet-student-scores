Answer 1:
Only three of the queries given will work. All 5 will work with minor adjustments to two of them, as shown below.

SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1; //(CORRECTED)

SELECT MAX(salary) FROM emp WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM emp);

SELECT salary FROM (SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 2) AS emp ORDER BY salary LIMIT 1;

SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM (SELECT salary FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 2) AS emp ORDER BY salary LIMIT 1;

SELECT salary FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1; // (CORRECTED)

Answer 2:
SELECT g.yr, c.country FROM games g
JOIN city
ON c.name=g.city

Answer 3:
Left join takes all the data from the first table, and then joins the specific data from the second table..
So if I were to select the year from the games table, and left-join the country from the city table where
the city names match, the program would select all the data I call from the games table, including the
year where the city data is missing. It would also return the entries where the join condition matches,
i.e. it would select Greece, China and UK.
The Opposite is the case for a right join. If I select all the countries on the right, and right-join
the year on the city name from the left table, the database would return all the entries on the country column,
and join the year 2004, 2008, and 2012 for Greece, China and UK respectively, but it will leave the year data
for Australia blank.
